# I2C Master Controller – VHDL Implementation


This repository contains a synthesizable I2C Master Controller written in VHDL, developed as part of an advanced digital design project.  
The implementation strictly conforms to the I²C protocol and supports precise timing, edge-synchronized transitions, and bidirectional data control.  
The design reflects a high standard of engineering discipline, optimized for both simulation and hardware integration.

This project was awarded the highest academic grade (A) in ELE113 – HW & SW systemdesign.
